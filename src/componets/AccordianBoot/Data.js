    {
        question: 'Is there a whitelist?',
        answer: 'Owners of 1/300 Genesis-Bootlegs on Opensea will have access to the sale 24 hours before the public sale. You must be verified as a "Bootleg" to be given private access. Each Genesis-Bootleg contains 5 induvidual NFTs, hence owners of these Bootlegs will be able mint up to 1500 "Doorfinn (As Seen On TV)."'

    {
        question: 'Which secondaries?',
        answer: 'We will be on as many secondaries as possible, with "Magic Eden" and "Solanart" as the ideal first two. We are also working to ensure we have rarity tools in place by release day, as well as sales bot associated with all secondary websites shortly after.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Do we own the IP of our Doorfinn?',
        answer: 'Yes. You own every aspect of your Doorfinn NFT (minus the dialogue as a whole), as well as the right to own all subsequent hand-made derivative works by Dsty at no expense. The license is non-exculsive however, meaning we can use all the Doorfinns for whatever projects we would like in order to expand their footprint (finnprint) - i.e. 1/1 Statue Art, merchandise, live shwocases and Performances, etc. Those projects will be be heavily involved and managed by the DoorfinnDAO, and will build the community ,uch stronger after the initial release.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Bootlegs are on Eth, and Doorfinns are on Sol... Why the split?',
        answer: 'Solana has the fastest transactions and lowest fees for minting and aquiring NFTs. Our first time aping into a project on Sol was by far the best expirience ive had with NFTs. Its an extremely young ecosystem that we believe in whole heartedly as one day the dominate NFT chain.'
