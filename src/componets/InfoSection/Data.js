    description: 'Well over a century ago, a Great Flood swept through the secluded continent of Doorfinndale, and seperated an already fractured population. Strangely the last few months that would usually be filled with war and strife was quickly tunred into hope at the sight of the waters beginning recession. Now, the water levels have returned to the levels only talked about as legend. We join our Doorfinn now, happier than ever to meet new people and stake new claim on long forgotten land. Instead of being just deflationary, burned Doorfinn are scooped up by all their induvidual parts and combined with other lost souls for the show of their lifetime - "Hey, Neighbor! of Doorfinndale" a .gif series featuring combinations of burned Doorfinn in their ultimate form as meaningless actors on a meaningless Metavision show.',

    description: 'With the Solana NFT ecosystem being so young, it is imperative for me as a young artist to provide value for the long run. One year from now Doorfinns will be physical statues, pointless-detailed costumes, and an identity within the larger culture that will be NFTs. The Bootlegs-Brand gives me the range to create beyond the Doorfinns or Bootlegs, while never forgetting where it started. I hope Doorfinns can be your first or somebody you knows first NFT, though im assuming most of you are doorgens. Giving holders a reason to hold is the only sensical way for an artist to exist in this space. I am an artist and my name is my word, this project and all other X-Bootleg productions will be handled with care for eons upon digital eons to come. I am not just an artist with paints, but see the new Web3 tools as a neccessary learning curve for whatever metaverse comes next.',
