    description: 'Well over a century ago, a Great Flood swept through the secluded continent of Doorfinndale, and seperated an already fractured population. Strangely enough, the last few months - usually filled with war and strife - have been instead filled with unanimous hope at the sight of the waters beginning recession. Now, the water levels have returned to the levels only talked about in legend. We join our Doorfinn now, happier than ever to meet new people and stake new claim on long forgotten lands and beaches. Instead of being just deflationary NFTs, burned Doorfinn are scooped up by all their induvidual parts and combined with other lost souls for the show of their lifetime - "Hey, Neighbor! of Doorfinndale" a .gif series featuring combinations of burned Doorfinn in their ultimate form as meaningless actors on a meaningless Metavision show. Remember, Floorfinns got lost in the Floods',

    description: 'With the Solana NFT ecosystem being so young, it is imperative for me as a young artist to provide value for the long run. In less than 3 months from now Doorfinns will be physical statues, pointless-detailed costumes, and an identity within the larger culture that will be NFTs. The Bootlegs-Brand gives me the range to create beyond the Doorfinns or Bootlegs, while never forgetting where it started. I hope Doorfinns can be your first or somebody you knows first NFT, though im assuming most of you are doorgens. Giving holders a reason to hold is the only sensical way for an artist to exist in this space. I am an artist and my name is my word, this project and all other X-Bootleg productions will be handled with care for eons upon digital eons to come. I am not just an artist with paints, but see the new Web3 tools as a neccessary learning curve for whatever metaverse comes next.',

Blank Story-Archs will be grant holders the ability to complete a full Story-Chain of 8 integral story elements. There will be up to 100 different story archs, and only 100 complete sets. Blanks need a Bootleg to be given color, and Bootleg-Owners get to decide the supply of which color. Once a set is combined, individual Blanks are burned and a short film containing all story elements is returned. This will act as Founders DAO tokens, and will grant ownership over a TheatreChain in the coming year. Burn, Tear, and Punch events will be limited timed. To create a game of supply, holders may be incentivized to burn, tear, or punch their tickets. But holders will always have an episode down the pipeline if they are willing to hold.',
