        answer: '"Doorfinn (as seen on TV) is a 2D art project on the Solana Blockchain. Bootlegs is the overarching brand, and moreover a 3D art project on the Ethereum Blockchain. There are 8,888 Doorfinn, and only 300 Bootlegs as of now.' 
    },
    {
        question: 'What is mint price? Where is minting?',
        answer: 'Mint price is 0.5 Sol for each Doorfinn; mintable through our website mint page extension (www.bootlegs.wtf/mint).'
    },
    {
        question: 'Is there a whitelist?',
        answer: 'Owners of 1/300 Genesis-Bootlegs on Opensea will have access to the sale 24 hours before the public sale. You must be verified as a "Bootleg" to be given private access. Each Genesis-Bootleg contains 5 induvidual NFTs, hence owners of these Bootlegs will be able mint up to 1500 "Doorfinn (As Seen On TV)."'

    {
        question: 'Which secondaries?',
        answer: 'We will be on as many secondaries as possible, with "Magic Eden" and "Solanart" as the ideal first two. We are also working to ensure we have rarity tools in place by release day, as well as sales bot associated with all secondary websites shortly after.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Do we own the IP of our Doorfinn?',
        answer: 'Yes. You own every aspect of your Doorfinn NFT (minus the dialogue as a whole), as well as the right to own all subsequent hand-made derivative works by Dsty at no expense. The license is non-exculsive however, meaning we can use all the Doorfinns for whatever projects we would like in order to expand their footprint (finnprint) - i.e. 1/1 Statue Art, merchandise, live shwocases and Performances, etc. Those projects will be be heavily involved and managed by the DoorfinnDAO, and will build the community ,uch stronger after the initial release.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Why Solana?',
        answer: 'Solana has the fastest transactions and lowest fees for minting and aquiring NFTs. Our first time aping into a project on Sol was by far the best expirience ive had with NFTs. Its an extremely young ecosystem that we believe in whole heartedly as one day the dominate NFT chain.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Really, Why Solana?',
        answer: 'Any artist wants to be first. We want to be known as artists in this space, and we do not want to be left behind when theres so much building to do, on a chain that we believe will scale to be huge. Our biggest fear is timing the market, releasing at the right time and in the right place. Solana feels right, at the exact moment Ethereum doesnt in regards to the NFT market. We want to get our friends into this space. That is why we believe in Solana, and equivelent proof-of-history protocols for NFTs. From art to films, we believe that is the only way to truly ever aquire something without needing to worry about wallet-exhausting fees.'
