        question: 'Which secondaries?',
        answer: 'We will be on as many secondaries as possible, with "Magic Eden" and "Solanart" as the ideal first two. We are also working to ensure we have rarity tools in place by release day, as well as sales bot associated with all secondary websites.'

        question: 'Do we own the IP of our Doorfinn?',
        answer: 'Yes. You own every aspect of your Doorfinn NFT (minus the dialogue as a whole), as well as the right to own all subsequent hand-made derivative works by Dsty at no expense. The license is non-exculsive however, meaning we can use all the Doorfinns for whatever projects I would like - i.e. 1/1 Statue Art, merchandise, etc. Those projects will be be heavily involved and managed by the DoorfinnDAO.'

    {
        question: 'Why Solana?',
        answer: 'Solana has the fastes transactions and lowest fees for minting and aquiring NFTs. My first time aping into a project on Sol was by far the ebst expirience Ive had with NFTs. Its an extremely young ecosystem that I believe in whole heartedly as one day the dominate NFT chain.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Really, Why Solana?',
        answer: 'I want to get my friends into this space, and I want to be able to send them NFTs. That is why I believe in Solana, and equivelent proof-of-history protocols for NFTs. From art to films, I believe that is the only way to truly ever own something without needing to worry about wallet-exhausting fees.'
